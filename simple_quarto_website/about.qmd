# Topic: Exponential Distribution
The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is often used to model waiting times, such as the time between arrivals at a queue.

## Probability Density Function
The PDF of an exponential distribution is:
$$ 
f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x},x \geq 0
$$

### Plot of the Exponential Distribution

plt.title('Exponential Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.grid(True)
