# Basic Information  <!-- h1 header -->
Common probability distributions include the Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Exponential Distribution, and Uniform Distribution. 

## Section 1: Normal Distribution   <!-- h2 header -->
The normal distribution is one of the most common probability distributions in statistics. It is a continuous distribution defined by its mean $\mu$ standard deviation $\sigma$. The normal distribution is symmetric around the mean.

### Subsection 1.1: Details <!-- h3 header -->

Probability Density Function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left( - \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)
$$

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li> $\mu$ is the mean</li>
  <li> $\sigma$ is the standard deviation</li>
</ul>

It is also central to the Central Limit Theorem.[^1]

[^1]: Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of many independent and identically distributed random variables tends to be normally distributed, regardless of their original distribution.


## Section 2: Poisson Distribution

**Definition of the Poisson Distribution**: 
<p>The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It assumes that these events happen at a constant rate and independently of each other.</p>

**Applications of the Poisson Distribution**: 
<p>It is commonly used to model phenomena such as the number of phone calls received in an hour.</p>

## Section 3: Feature Comparison Table

| Distribution | Description | Parameters |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Normal  | Models continuous data, symmetric around the mean.       | Mean $\mu$, Standard Deviation $\sigma$   |
| Poisson    | Models the count of events in a fixed interval.        | Rate $\mu$    |

The probability density function of the normal distribution is given by: $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left( - \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)$ , while The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by: $P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$

> The normal distribution is continuous and models variables like height or temperature with a symmetric, bell-shaped curve, while the Poisson distribution is discrete and models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval, like the number of calls received per hour.
